Common:
  - implement svn diff --git support into gen_branch_workingset.bat/sync_branch_workingsset.bat, tests
  - scm/svn/* tests
  - tests for index_patch_file.bat on patch with "Index: ", "@@ " and "GIT binary patch" sequences not in the beginning of lines

Tests for autodetect (-ad) in svn_gen_branch_workingset.bat:
  - in WC directory w/o .svn subdirectory, but w/ .svn subdirectory in parent directory
  - in WC directory w/o .svn subdirectory, but w/ .svn subdirectory in child directory
  - in local repo (file:///) directory
  - in directory not under SVN control (w/o autodetect, and with autodetect but w/o .svn subdirectory inside parent/child directories)

Tests for svn_sync_branch_workingset.bat:
  - sync directories between revisions where a directory was an external and removed from externals
  - sync directories between revisions where a directory was an external and became internal and vice versa
  - sync directories where an external directory removed between revisions but having local changes. Script must stop with an error if the auto revert flag is not set
  - sync w/ the fresh checkout flag and w/o must gain equal results if no collisions
  - sync with in-a-repository relocation should not leave directories with the S suffix (switched) in the svnversion output
  - sync w/ binary files add/remove/change
  - sync w/ tree changes (gen must be implemented with "svn diff --git" support)
  - sync w/o any flags
  - sync w/ an external has local changes but must be removed
  - sync external with URL relocation, where patch from the gen contains URL changes
  - sync and break in middle of parent wc.db update, where EXTERNALS tabdle processed for insert/update/delete
  - sync with local changes in nested externals with the -ignore_nested_externals_local_changes flag set

Test for svn_remove_externals.bat/svn_remove_external.bat/svn_remove_external_dir.bat:
  - sync where content of the external directory already partially removed
  - sync where the external directory does not have .svn subdirectory
  - sync where path to an external directory half removed (for example, dir1/dir2/ext does not exist, but dir1/dir2 is the external path)

Tests for svn_changeset.bat:
  - in WC directory w/o .svn subdirectory, but w/ .svn subdirectory in parent directory
  - in local repo (file:///) directory
  - in directory not under SVN control

Tests for svn_changeset.bat:
  - in WC directory w/o .svn subdirectory, but w/ .svn subdirectory in parent directory
  - output from the script on SVN WC directory w/o .svn subdirectory, but w/ .svn subdirectory in parent directory w/ flags -offline -wcroot flags should be the same to the output w/o -offline flag and w/ --depth infinity --non-interactive flags
  - in local repo (file:///) directory
  - in directory not under SVN control

so on...
